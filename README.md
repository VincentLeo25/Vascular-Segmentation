# Vascular-Segmentation
This is my project about liver vessel segmentation in CT images based on the Hessian matrix and U-Net networks

# Datasets
We used the data taken from the [3DIRCADb-01 database of liver segmentation images from IRCAD](https://www.ircad.fr/research/data-sets/liver-segmentation-3d-ircadb-01/), France, and the experimental results were compared with those from expert manual segmentation.

# Results
The left side shows the segmentation results of our model and the right side shows the results of expert manual segmentation.
